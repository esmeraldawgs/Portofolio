### About me :wave:
Hi, I’m Esmeralda. Since the beginning of 2023, I’ve been dedicated to studying and practicing to become a Quality Assurance (QA) professional. I’m excited to have found a field where I can truly develop and contribute. In my QA role, I see the opportunity to enhance the digital world and make it more accessible for everyone.

In this portfolio, I’m sharing my QA knowledge and showcasing the practical skills I’ve gained through courses, self-study, and professional experience. I’m committed to continuous growth in this field and have recently begun focusing on test automation to further expand my expertise.

### My experience :office:
My journey into Quality Assurance began with an internship at Indomaret Group, where I was introduced to the fundamentals of QA practices. During this period, I gained essential experience in software testing, including designing test plans, scenarios, and procedures.

At PT Indomarco Prismatama, I further honed my QA skills by creating and managing test cases for two products with three user roles, totaling over 150 test cases. I played a key role in analyzing test results and reporting findings to the development team. Collaborating closely with developers to address and resolve bugs deepened my understanding of both manual and automated testing processes.

Currently, I am working as a Software Quality Assurance and Application Support at Mostrans. In this role, I perform both manual and automation testing using WebDriverIO and Cypress with JavaScript. I create comprehensive technical documentation to guide users and internal teams, and monitor and test API functionality with Postman.

I am responsible for ensuring system continuity through daily checks and managing over 500-800 support tickets per month, demonstrating a commitment to user satisfaction. My efforts in implementing support innovations have led to a 15% reduction in monthly support tickets. Additionally, I oversee the delivery of support innovations through UAT and live production phases, ensuring effective implementation and continuous improvement of solutions.

These experiences have significantly enhanced my technical and analytical skills and have fueled my passion for QA. I am now eager to continue growing in this field, particularly in test automation, to further refine my expertise and contribute effectively to the quality of digital products.
